B. Rochelle Fisher is an experienced, accomplished technical writer, manager, and trainer. You won't see this in her resume, because it's been too long, but she is certified to teach high school English. Her degree is a double-major in Linguistics and Education. She is familiar with the USA DoD SCORM standard and can create training material structured for optimal learning. Beyond the two or three years of teaching high school EFL (English as a Foreign Language) in Israel, she has also taught two courses in technical writing.

As a traditional technical writer, Rochelle was always ahead of the game. She does not wait to be spoon-fed by developers. She can read code and explain what it does and what the user must change to make it accomplish the goes.

As a manager, Rochelle believes the main objective of a manager is to help her employees improve, to better serve and deliver. She explains this in detail in her book, _Alchemy of Tomes: Managing Technical Writers and Documentation Projects_.
