B. Rochelle Fisher is an experienced, accomplished technical writer, manager, and trainer.

## Writer

As a traditional technical writer, Rochelle was always ahead of the game. She does not wait to be spoon-fed by developers. She can read code and explain what it does and what the user must change to make it accomplish the goals.

Rochelle has more than twenty years of technical writing experience, including API docs, user guides, admin guides, release notes, man pages, and Knowledge Base articles. She has proven her ability to develop and deliver high quality documentation and technical content translated to simple, relevant, task-based procedures.

## Manager

As a manager, Rochelle believes the main objective of a manager is to help her employees improve, to better serve and deliver. She explains this in detail in her book, _Alchemy of Tomes: Managing Technical Writers and Documentation Projects_.

Rochelle has fifteen years of management experience for multiple products, projects, and user personas. She has proven her ability to quickly learn complex technical subject matter and to effectively collaborate with various teams to set documentation requirements and roadmaps.

## Trainer

You won't see this in her resume, because it's been too long, but she is certified to teach high school English. Her degree is a double-major in Linguistics and Education. She is familiar with the USA DoD SCORM standard and can create training material structured for optimal learning. Rochelle has a couple years experience teaching high school EFL (English as a Foreign Language) in Israel. She has taught professional courses in technical writing.

This means that Rochelle can deliver your technical information as self-service learning.

## Personal Mission Statement

> "I believe quality technical writing is a symbiotic marriage between power and simplicity. Every line serves a purpose, every detail is indispensable, and the finished product is a perfect union of comprehensive instruction and concise communication."
> -- [The Art of Technical Writing](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140826081211-491421-the-art-of-technical-writing/)

Rochelle is passionate about clear, concise writing, leading to customer success and trust. She is an avid advocate of Controlled Language and taxonomy as tools to achieve said quality. Her **Project** to document how to create a CL showcases this passion and commitment.
